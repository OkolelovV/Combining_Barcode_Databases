# Combining_Barcode_Databases
Filtering and combining two databases containing 8,5M and 3.5M barcodes of different types using Python and SQLite. After that, the resulting file is used for reading real barcodes and seaching them in the database. In addition, the program attempts to fix incorrect checksum digits.    
The types of barcodes handled: EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E.  
I cannot provide the data for free, since it is valuable.
